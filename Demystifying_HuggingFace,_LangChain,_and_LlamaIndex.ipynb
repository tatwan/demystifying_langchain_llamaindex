            "\"This article discusses the importance of probabilistic forecasting for renewable energy generation, specifically focusing on solar power. The authors propose a nonparametric approach for very short-term predictive densities, using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a fast regression model. The study evaluates the proposed approach and compares it to four benchmark methods, showing that it results in skillful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.

            "The article discusses the use of intra-hour solar irradiance forecasting by predicting cloud motions and locations. It also explores the development of a neural network-based reforecasting method to improve forecast accuracy. The focus is on probabilistic predictions to provide decision-making under uncertainty with full information. The article also mentions the surge of interest in stochastic optimization approaches to cover different uncertainties in power systems and electricity markets.

            "The study discusses the challenges of probabilistic forecasting and the limitations of existing methods, particularly in the context of solar energy forecasting. It highlights the need for nonparametric density forecasts to avoid restrictive assumptions on the shape of predictive distributions. The proposed framework uses quantile regression and ELM as a regression solver to generate nonparametric density forecasts, taking into account feasibility, reliability, and sharpness of predictive densities. The study emphasizes the differences in stochastic process dynamics and influential variables between wind and PV power forecasts, and the need for accurate probabilistic forecasting in the absence of cloud passage forecasts.\n",

The ELM algorithm is found to have good generalization performance and is much faster than traditional learning algorithms. The study compares the performance of ELM with classical linear regression models and AutoRegressive models, and finds that ELM leads to the best accuracy with satisfactory computational costs. The experimental framework involves using time series data from two different PV sites with different climatic regions. The article highlights the challenges of forecasting PV generation due to its high variability and uncertainty, and emphasizes the importance of high-quality forecasts in dealing with potential imbalances in power generation dynamics.\n",

            "The process involves generating training datasets by resampling with replacement from the original dataset and training separate ELMs for each bootstrapped dataset. The mean of the distribution of predictions is calculated as the output of the bootstrapped ELMs, and the variance of the outputs is regarded as the uncertainty of the data. To estimate uncertainty, the targets are replaced with a transformed dataset, and resampling with replacement is carried out to generate multiple bootstrapped ELMs.\n",

The study examines the reliability and sharpness of the probabilistic forecasts and provides examples of forecasted episodes for different cases. The approach reacts to the high intermittency and variability in PV generation patterns, and the prediction intervals are not symmetric around the point forecasts.

The BELM method shows acceptable skill scores but low reliability, with overly narrow and sharp quantiles that do not cover most of the variability in PV generation. The HIA method also performs poorly in terms of reliability and sharpness. The study concludes that the assumptions of Gaussian distribution and low uncertainty in the BELM method do not align with the actual variability and uncertainty in PV generation, leading to unreliable forecasts.\n",

The article still discusses the importance of probabilistic forecasting for renewable energy generation, particularly focusing on solar power, and proposes a nonparametric approach for very short-term predictive densities using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The study evaluates the proposed method against benchmark probabilistic methods and highlights the challenges and importance of forecasting in integrating intermittent renewable energy generation into power system operations and electricity markets. The article also emphasizes the need to avoid restrictive assumptions on the shape of predictive distributions and proposes a framework to generate nonparametric density forecasts for solar energy. The empirical investigation evaluates the feasibility of the approach for solar power application and compares it against relevant benchmarks, such as persistence, climatology, HIA, and BELM. Additionally, the analysis of forecast error distributions is considered, highlighting the conditional mean as an important variable conditioning prediction intervals or conditional PDFs.\n",
